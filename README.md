# National University Marketing Web Dev team standards

Here you will find the coding standards that should be used by all members for some of the following reasons:

- Consistency across projects.
- Code should look like one person coded the project.
- Easier to jump into a project and start work right away, instead of learning the coding methods too.
- Standards from the community and technology.
